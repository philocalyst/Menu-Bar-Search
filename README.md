## Usage

- Type `m` in Alfred to list menu bar items for the front-most application.
- You can filter menu items by name, or use fuzzy searching.
- Alternatively, you can set a hotkey to trigger the workflow.


**Examples:**

- Typing `m new tab` will match the menu item **New Tab**.
- Typing `m cw` will match the menu item **Close Window**.

## Building
You need to be on SPM 6+.

`swift build -c release -Xswiftc "-whole-module-optimization"`
